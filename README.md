# RPNc

RPNc{ompiler} can compile a Reversh Polish Notation ("RPN") expression into
y86 assembly.

Inspired by [math-compiler](https://github.com/skx/math-compiler) by
Steve Kemp.

## Build

**RPNc** is written in C# and targets .NET Core 3.1 (with plans to implement
my mono build system so it can run on mono on OpenBSD).

To build on Windows:
    PS C:\rpnc> cd src
    PS C:\rpnc\src> dotnet build

## Maths

**RPNc** can compile RPN expressions such as `9 1 +`. Expressions are limited
to integer operations: there is no floating point support because my toy
simulator (**yess**) only supports 32bit integers.

### Supported Operations

* Addition - `+`
* Subtraction - `-`

### Planned (But Not Yet Implemented) Operation Support

* Multiplication - `*`
* Division - `/` (integer division)
* Power - `^`
* Modulo - `%`
* And - `and` (bitwise)
* Xor - `xor` (bitwise)
* Duplication - `dup`
* Swap - `swap`

## Errors

**RPNc** attempts to detect and report some common errors at compile-time and
runtime.

### Compile-Time Errors

There are some...

### Runtime Errors

Any runtime errors will be reported by setting codes in the `%esi` and
`%edi` registers. First, `%esi` will be set to _-1_ like so:

    %esi: ffffffff

Then, `%edi` will be set to one of the following error numbers:

* `0x01`: **EDIV** - divide by zero
* `0x02`: **ESTACK** - RPN stack does not have enough values for an operation
* `0x04`: **ESTACKFULL** - RPN stack contains too many values at the end of
  program evaluation
